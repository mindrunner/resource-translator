\begin{abstract}
  The task was to develop a application which takes a $resx$ file as an input and
  outputs another $resx$ file with its content translated to a different
  language. The translation should be made with help of translation memories in
  TMX format, as well as external translator services, such as online translators
  like Google Translate. This document covers the implementation report, as well
  as occurred problems while implementing the application.

\section{Statement of Completeness}

The assignment has been fully completed and so far, the system is fully functional. The following section lists all implemented features.

\section{Functionality}

\subsection{Essential Features}

The following basic functionality has been implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A GUI for communicating with the user
  \item $resx$ files can be loaded, displayed, and saved
  \item Translation memories from TMX files can be loaded, modified and saved
  \item A $DataGrid$ shows the content of the loaded $resx$ file as well as the
    translation of it
  \item The User can translate items by himself
  \item Source and destination cultures are displayed after loading $resx$ and
    TMX file. If the TMX file supports multiple cultures, the user can choose
    one of those instead of using the default value.
  \item The user can exit from the application nicely
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optional Features}

The following optional features have been implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Google Translate can be used as an external translation service for
    items which could not be found in the TMX file.
  \item A fuzzy string matching system has been implemented. Three modi are
    available: None, Manual and Auto
  \item A CLI with the same functionality has been implemented
\end{itemize}

\section{Possible problems with online translation}

The Google Translate API is not free. Therefore, this implementation does not use the API, but uses GET-calls to the website and parses its output. Google might change this interface at any time without any warning. Please consider this while marking and contact me if there are any problems with that.

\section{A small introduction}

Figure~\ref{fig:app} shows the GUI with annotations on the elementary user choices.

\begin{enumarabic}
\item Load RESX and TMX file, save and export RESX and TMX files
\item Select language, if TMX supports more than one
\item Select fuzziness mode and value
\item Activate or deactivate Google Translate
\item Select, if original TMX file should be updated after saving the destination RESX
\item Start the translation process
\end{enumarabic}
